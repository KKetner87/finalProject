    <p class="text-center"><b class="bolded">Running Alone Can Be Risky for Women</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Most female runners will agree that they know “what to do to stay safe.” You are aware of your surroundings, trust your instincts,
      and stay within a shouting distance of other people. However, if you are ever put in an unfortunate position
      facing someone who is intent on harming you, these standard safety tips may not be enough to make a difference. </p>
    <br>

    <p class="text-center"><b class="bolded">Midrun Harassment Isn’t Rare</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>In October 2016, Runner’s World published a report that discussed the harassment that many women runners endure. The survery collected responses from
      4,670 runners (2,533 women and 2,137 men) show that 43 percent of women at least sometimes experience harassment on the run, compared to just 4 percent
      of men.</p>

    <p class="text-center"><b class="bolded">Don't Be a Victim!</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>You can protect yourself each and every time you're running solo with the safety app Protego. Protego allows you to set up a network of
      trusted contacts, who can track your route and make sure you get home safe. You can also see the recently reported assaults near your
      intended running route before ever leaving the house by viewing the crime markers on our map. </p>
    <br>
    <p>If you ever feel threatened on your run, Protego has a number built-in features to protect you. You can practice
    simple and effective self-defense techniques for women by choosing a video from our playlist included in your account page
    or simply press the panic button to alert your contacts of your exact location and set off a siren to discourage an attack.
